# Introduction | BurnCloud API

The BurnCloud AI API service platform provides on-demand access to a wide range of powerful AI models and capabilities. Our platform is designed to offer advanced reasoning, content creation, and real-time processing solutions for various applications, from general conversation to complex enterprise tasks.

We provide comprehensive support for multiple large language models, ensuring that you can access the latest and most advanced AI technologies with a single API Key.

Here are some examples of what you can do with our API to power your applications, business operations, or workflows:

- **Access Multiple AI Models**: Retrieve capabilities from a variety of AI models, including GPT-4.5, GPT-4O, O1, O3-Mini, Sora, DALL·E 3, and more, using a single API Key.
- **Perform Advanced Reasoning**: Use models like GPT-4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Llama 3.3 70B to solve complex problems, analyze data, and generate high-quality content.
- **Generate Content**: Create text, images, videos, and more with models optimized for content creation, such as Sora for text-to-video generation and DALL·E 3 for advanced image synthesis.
- **Real-Time Applications**: Deploy lightweight models like O1-Mini and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite for real-time applications, mobile devices, and resource-constrained environments.
- **Historical and Comparative Data**: Access historical performance data and comparative analysis across different models to inform your decision-making process.

Maintaining an accurate and up-to-date dataset of AI models is our top priority. We source our models from leading AI developers and continuously update our platform to ensure you have access to the latest advancements in AI technology.

We combine and normalize model capabilities across multiple sources, allowing us to provide a comprehensive and accurate set of AI functionalities.

We continuously update our internal database and process over [X] model updates daily. Updated data is immediately available via our API without delays or caching.

We offer a free API plan that includes up to 50 free API requests per month, so you can test our API and develop your integration without any upfront commitments or long-term contracts.

Our paid API plans have a transparent and predictable pricing model that scales with your API request volume, and gives you access to advanced AI capabilities at an extremely competitive cost.

You can start, change, or stop your API plan at any time from your online API dashboard. View this guide to learn more about billing and managing your API subscription.

Visit our website to view our current API pricing, or contact us if you're interested in higher-volume enterprise plans.

We offer flexible licensing terms that allow you to use our API and AI models for any use case that is not specifically prohibited under our Terms of Use.

This includes using our API and AI models for internal business purposes, creating derivative works and commercial products, storing data on your internal systems, and distributing it to end-users of your applications.

We do not require you to add attribution or BurnCloud branding to your applications or products that incorporate our AI models, although you can add our approved branding if you'd like. Send us an email to support@burncloud.com and we'll be happy to provide you with logos and images you can use.

To get started, create a BurnCloud account to access your API dashboard and generate your first API key. View this guide for a detailed walkthrough of how to do this.

Once you generate your API key and select one of the available API plans, you can start using any of our available API endpoints to retrieve AI capabilities and integrate them into your applications.

Our API documentation includes interactive sandbox playgrounds, where you can test the various endpoints directly in the browser, view example responses, and generate ready-to-use code snippets in many popular programming languages.

Our support team is available 7 days a week to answer your questions and provide help with your integration via live chat or email.

You can contact us by launching the live chat at the bottom right of this website, or by sending an email to support@burncloud.com.
