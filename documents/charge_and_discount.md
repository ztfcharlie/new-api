# BurnCloud AI Pricing Guide: Complete Analysis of Billing Methods and Discount Offers

## How does the system charge?
### Basic Concepts
1. **Model Pricing**
   - Our model prices are published on the [Pricing](https://ai.burncloud.com/pricing) page
   - Prices match the official prices of corresponding models
   - Any discrepancies may be due to timing differences in updates

2. **Group Multiplier**
   - The group multiplier is the discount rate applied when calculating fees based on the user's current group
   - Used to differentiate between regular users and Business users
   - Different user groups have different discount rates, with Business users enjoying lower rates
   - Contact our business team for more details

### Calculation Method:
Pay-as-you-go fee = Group Multiplier × (Input tokens × Prompt price + Output tokens × Completion price)

**Example:**
- User's current group multiplier is 1
- On the Price page, GPT-4o costs: Prompt $2.5/1M tokens, Completion $10/1M tokens
- For a request with 1,000 input tokens and 2,000 output tokens
- The cost would be: 1 × (1,000 × $2.5/1,000,000 + 2,000 × $10/1,000,000) = $0.0035

## How can I get a discount?
